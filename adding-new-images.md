# ðŸ–¼ Adding New Images to the Hugo Site

This guide explains where to put new images for your site and how to reference them.

---

## âœ… Site-wide images

For general images used across the site (e.g., logos, banners, shared assets),  
place them in:

`static/images/`


### Example usage in Markdown:
```markdown
![Alt Text](/images/my-picture.jpg)
```
The /images/my-picture.jpg path refers to /static/images/my-picture.jpg.
